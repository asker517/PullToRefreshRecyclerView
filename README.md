# Pull To Refresh Recyclerview for Android
A simple build based on chrisbanes's [library](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh)..Nothing special , just use recyclerview implements PullToRefreshBase..then make recyclerview has pulltorefresh function...

## Change

  * Fix the bug in origin PullToRefreshGridView(if you use the widget...)
  * Add the widget PtrRecyclerView(the reason because I'm lazy,wanna use recyclerview instead Listview or GirdView..)
  
## Usage
It's the same as origin library,so please see the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) page.
